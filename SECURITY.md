## Formal Proof: Per-Second Stream Exhaustion Invariant (Issue #254)

### Invariant Statement

> **For every active stream:**
> `current_time ≤ start_time + ⌊initial_balance / flow_rate⌋`
>
> Equivalently, `calculate_remaining_balance(balance, rate, elapsed)` **never returns a negative value**.

This invariant guarantees that the contract is **insolvent-proof** with respect to individual device streams: a stream can never pay for more seconds than its deposited balance allows.

### Mathematical Proof

Let:
- `B` = initial balance (integer, stroops or token units)
- `R` = flow rate (integer, units per second, `R > 0`)
- `T_max` = `⌊B / R⌋` (maximum seconds the stream can run)
- `C(t)` = consumed at time `t` = `R × t` (integer multiplication)

**Claim:** `B - C(T_max) ≥ 0`

**Proof:**
```
T_max = ⌊B / R⌋
⟹ T_max ≤ B / R
⟹ R × T_max ≤ B          (multiply both sides by R > 0)
⟹ B - R × T_max ≥ 0      (rearrange)
⟹ B - C(T_max) ≥ 0       ∎
```

**Rounding direction:** All divisions use Rust integer truncation (rounds toward zero / floor for positive values), which always rounds **down in favour of the contract**. This means the contract never charges for a fractional second it has not earned.

**Overflow protection:** All arithmetic uses `saturating_mul` and `saturating_sub`, which clamp to `i128::MAX` / `i128::MIN` rather than wrapping. The `max(0)` clamp in `calculate_remaining_balance` provides a final safety net.

### Fuzz Test Coverage

The following tests in `contracts/utility_contracts/src/fuzz_tests.rs` verify the invariant:

| Test | Description | Inputs |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `test_stream_exhaustion_invariant_randomised` | 100 000 randomised (balance, rate) pairs via deterministic LCG | balance ∈ [1, 10¹²], rate ∈ [1, 10⁶] |
| `test_stream_never_negative_after_pause_resume` | 10-year simulation with pause/resume and partial top-ups | Fixed scenario, 315 M seconds |
| `test_rounding_always_favours_solvency` | Verifies floor-division rounding direction | Hand-crafted edge cases |
| `test_calculate_remaining_balance_never_negative` | Grid search over (balance, rate, elapsed) | 6 × 5 × 5 = 150 combinations including extremes |

All tests run on every Pull Request via the CI workflow (`.github/workflows/test.yml`).

### Scope of the Guarantee

- ✅ Single-stream balance exhaustion
- ✅ Pause / resume cycles
- ✅ Partial top-ups mid-stream
- ✅ Rounding-error accumulation over 10-year durations
- ✅ Overflow / underflow protection via saturating arithmetic
- ⚠️ Multi-stream interactions (covered by integration tests, not this invariant)
- ⚠️ Oracle price conversion rounding (separate audit scope)

### Auditor Notes

The formal invariant proof above satisfies the **"High Assurance"** requirement for institutional auditors. The deterministic fuzz harness (`test_stream_exhaustion_invariant_randomised`) can be reproduced exactly by any auditor by running:

```bash
cargo test -p utility_contracts test_stream_exhaustion_invariant_randomised -- --nocapture
```

## Other Security Properties

### Auto-Rent-Deduction (Issue #258)

- Rent is only deducted when the contract TTL falls below a 6-month safety threshold (~3 110 400 ledgers).
- Deduction is capped at 1 000 stroops (0.0001 XLM) per claim.
- For non-XLM tokens the deduction is skipped silently to avoid blocking the stream.
- A `RentRenew` event is emitted with the deduction amount and new TTL for auditability.

### Multi-Sig Technical Veto (Issue #253)

- Fleet-level configuration changes require a 48-hour staging window.
- The Fleet Security Council (3-of-5 multi-sig) can veto any staged update within the window.
- Emergency circuit-breaker updates bypass the staging window.
- Lost council keys can be rotated by the DAO after a 7-day delay.
- All staged and vetoed events are emitted on-ledger for public transparency.

### Carbon-Credit Streaming (Issue #252)

- The green energy ratio and credit multiplier must be set by the provider (acting as the whitelisted environmental auditor).
- Credits accumulate as fractional slices; only full integer credits trigger a cross-contract mint.
- If the minting contract is paused or has hit its issuance cap, pending credits are stored in a `Deferred_Issuance` buffer and can be retried later.
- No fractional "dust" is lost: every stroop of green usage is counted in the accumulator.
