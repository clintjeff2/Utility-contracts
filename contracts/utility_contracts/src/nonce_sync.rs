//! # Tamper-Proof Hardware Nonce Sync Module
//!
//! This module implements a strict Device_Nonce tracking system for IoT device liveness verification.
//! It prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and replay attacks by requiring strictly incrementing
//! nonces in every heartbeat payload.
//!
//! ## Security Features
//!
//! - **Replay Attack Prevention**: Each heartbeat must include a nonce exactly equal to current_nonce + 1
//! - **Network Jitter Tolerance**: Allows nonces within +1 to +5 window for UDP packet loss
//! - **Multi-Sig Reset**: Secure nonce reset for compromised devices with 3-of-5 authorization
//! - **Suspicious Device Detection**: Automatic marking of devices with frequent desyncs
//! - **Comprehensive Audit Trail**: All nonce operations emit events for forensic analysis
//!
//! ## Data Flow
//!
//! 1. Device sends heartbeat with signed nonce
//! 2. Contract verifies signature and nonce sequence
//! 3. If valid: updates nonce and continues streaming
//! 4. If invalid: emits alert and may mark device as suspicious
//! 5. Compromised devices require multi-sig nonce reset
//!
//! ## Issue Reference
//!
//! This module implements Issue #260: Tamper-Proof Hardware Nonce Sync
