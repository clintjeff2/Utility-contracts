//! # Ledger-Native Utility-Tariff Price Oracle Module
//!
//! This module implements a sophisticated Time-of-Use (ToU) pricing system that enables
//! utility companies to implement dynamic pricing based on the hour of the day. The oracle
//! stores 24-hour pricing schedules on-chain and provides seamless rate interpolation
//! for streams that span across multiple tariff windows.
//!
//! ## Key Features
//!
//! - **24-Hour Pricing Schedules**: Each hour can have different rates and tiers
//! - **Time-of-Use Support**: Off-peak, standard, peak, and critical peak pricing
//! - **Seamless Rate Interpolation**: Automatic blended rates for cross-window streams
//! - **Grid Administrator Control**: Secure signed tariff updates with notice periods
//! - **Temporary Storage Optimization**: Hourly lookups use efficient temporary storage
//! - **Renewable Energy Hours**: Special pricing for green energy periods
//!
//! ## Security Model
//!
//! - **Signed Updates**: All tariff changes must be signed by the Grid Administrator
//! - **Notice Period**: 24-hour notice period for tariff changes prevents surprises
//! - **Audit Trail**: Complete history of tariff updates with timestamps
//! - **Access Control**: Only authorized administrators can modify pricing
//!
//! ## Pricing Tiers
//!
//! - **Off-Peak**: Lowest rates, typically during night hours
//! - **Standard**: Normal daytime rates
//! - **Peak**: Higher rates during high-demand periods
//! - **Critical Peak**: Emergency rates during grid stress
//!
//! ## Use Cases
//!
//! - **Smart Grid Behavior**: Devices automatically throttle during expensive hours
//! - **Demand Response**: Consumers respond to price signals
//! - **Renewable Integration**: Lower rates during high renewable generation
//! - **Grid Stability**: Price-based load balancing
//!
//! ## Issue Reference

/// This constant defines the standard 24-hour day structure used for
/// Time-of-Use pricing. Each hour (0-23) can have its own rate and tier.
///
/// ## Hour Mapping
///
/// - Hours 0-6: Typically off-peak (night)
